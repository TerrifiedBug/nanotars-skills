# Add Parallel AI (MCP Servers)

Configures Parallel AI web research for agent containers using their HTTP-based MCP servers. Agents get tools for quick web search and deep research tasks.

## Preflight

Before installing, verify NanoClaw is set up:

```bash
[ -d node_modules ] && echo "DEPS: ok" || echo "DEPS: missing"
docker image inspect nanoclaw-agent:latest &>/dev/null && echo "IMAGE: ok" || echo "IMAGE: not built"
(grep -q "ANTHROPIC_API_KEY\|CLAUDE_CODE_OAUTH_TOKEN" .env 2>/dev/null || [ -f ~/.claude/.credentials.json ]) && echo "AUTH: ok" || echo "AUTH: missing"
```

If any check fails, tell the user to run `/nanotars-setup` first and stop.

## Prerequisites

- Parallel AI API key from https://platform.parallel.ai

## Step 1: Check Existing Configuration

```bash
grep "^PARALLEL_API_KEY=" .env 2>/dev/null && echo "KEY_SET" || echo "KEY_MISSING"
[ -d plugins/parallel ] && echo "PLUGIN_EXISTS" || echo "PLUGIN_MISSING"
```

If already configured, ask the user if they want to reconfigure or just verify.

## Step 2: Get API Key

Ask the user:

> Do you have a Parallel AI API key, or should I help you get one?

**If they need one:**

> 1. Go to https://platform.parallel.ai
> 2. Sign up or log in
> 3. Navigate to API Keys section
> 4. Create a new API key
> 5. Copy the key and paste it here

Wait for the API key.

## Step 3: Save to .env

```bash
sed -i '/^PARALLEL_API_KEY=/d' .env
echo "PARALLEL_API_KEY=THE_KEY_HERE" >> .env
```

Sync to container environment:

```bash
cp .env data/env/env
```

## Step 4: Install Plugin

```bash
cp -r ${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/files/ plugins/parallel/
```

## Step 5: Plugin Configuration

By default this plugin is available to all groups and channel types. To restrict access, edit `plugins/parallel/plugin.json` and set:
- `"groups"` to specific group folder names (e.g., `["main"]`) instead of `["*"]`
- `"channels"` to specific channel types (e.g., `["whatsapp"]`) instead of `["*"]`

Ask the user if they want to restrict access. Most users will keep the defaults.

## Step 6: Build and Restart

```bash
npm run build
systemctl restart nanoclaw  # or launchctl on macOS
```

## Verify

Send a message in your channel like:
- "What's the latest news about AI?"
- "Search for recent developments in quantum computing"

The agent now has Parallel AI search and deep research tools. Quick search is used freely; deep research asks for permission first.

## Troubleshooting

- **Agent says "no Parallel tools available"**: Check that `plugins/parallel/mcp.json` has the MCP server entries and `PARALLEL_API_KEY` is in `.env`
- **401 Unauthorized**: API key is invalid -- regenerate at https://platform.parallel.ai
- **Connection timeout**: Parallel AI servers may be down -- check https://status.parallel.ai
- **Deep research tasks never complete**: Check that the scheduler is running and the polling task was created

**Per-group overrides:** If a specific group needs a different Parallel API key, add `PARALLEL_API_KEY=...` to `groups/{folder}/.env`. See `/create-skill-plugin` for details.

## Remove

1. `rm -rf plugins/parallel/`
2. Remove env var from .env:
   ```bash
   sed -i '/^PARALLEL_API_KEY=/d' .env
   cp .env data/env/env
   ```
3. Rebuild and restart
