# Add Discord Channel

This skill installs the Discord channel plugin and registers a Discord chat.

**If the plugin is already installed** (check `plugins/channels/discord/`), skip to "Register a Chat" below.

## Preflight

Before installing, verify NanoTars is set up:

```bash
[ -d node_modules ] && echo "DEPS: ok" || echo "DEPS: missing"
docker image inspect nanoclaw-agent:latest &>/dev/null && echo "IMAGE: ok" || echo "IMAGE: not built"
if grep -q "ANTHROPIC_API_KEY\|CLAUDE_CODE_OAUTH_TOKEN" .env 2>/dev/null || [ -f "$HOME/.claude/.credentials.json" ]; then echo "AUTH: ok"; else echo "AUTH: missing"; fi
```

If any check fails, tell the user to run `/nanotars-setup` first and stop.

## Prerequisites

### 1. Create a Discord Bot

Tell the user:

> I need you to create a Discord bot:
>
> 1. Go to the [Discord Developer Portal](https://discord.com/developers/applications)
> 2. Click **New Application**, give it a name
> 3. Go to **Bot** in the left sidebar
> 4. Click **Reset Token** and copy the bot token
> 5. Under **Privileged Gateway Intents**, enable:
>    - **Message Content Intent** (required to read message text)
>    - **Server Members Intent** (optional, for display names)
> 6. Go to **OAuth2 > URL Generator**:
>    - Scopes: `bot`
>    - Bot Permissions: `Send Messages`, `Read Message History`, `View Channels`
> 7. Copy the generated URL and open it to invite the bot to your server

Wait for the user to provide the bot token.

**Note on DMs:** You must share at least one server with the bot before you can DM it directly.

## Install

1. Install discord.js (per-plugin dependency):
   ```bash
   cd plugins/channels/discord && npm install && cd -
   ```
   The plugin has its own `package.json` — dependencies are isolated from the core.

2. Check if plugin files exist:
   ```bash
   [ -d plugins/channels/discord ] && echo "PLUGIN_EXISTS" || echo "NEED_PLUGIN"
   ```

3. If needed, copy channel plugin files into place:
   ```bash
   mkdir -p plugins/channels/discord
   cp -r ${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/files/* plugins/channels/discord/
   ```

4. Add bot token to `.env` (get from user, never echo full token):
   ```bash
   echo "DISCORD_BOT_TOKEN=user_provided_token" >> .env
   ```

5. Rebuild and restart:
   ```bash
   npm run build
   nanotars restart 2>/dev/null
   ```

6. Verify the bot connected:
   ```bash
   sleep 3 && grep -i 'discord.*connected' logs/nanotars.log | tail -1
   ```

## Register a Chat

Use the cross-channel pairing-code flow (same primitive that backs WhatsApp + Telegram):

1. From your main chat (any registered channel), type `/register-group <folder>`. The host emits a 4-digit code.
2. From the Discord chat you want to register, send the 4-digit code as a normal message. The host's inbound interceptor consumes the code and atomically wires the entity-model rows.

**Manually finding a channel ID** (only if needed for documentation / scripted setup):
- Discord **User Settings > Advanced > Developer Mode** → enable
- Right-click the channel/DM → **Copy Channel ID**
- Format as `dc:CHANNEL_ID`

For the first-ever main chat (when no other channel is registered), use `nanotars pair-main` from the install host instead — it issues a code that the channel plugin's inbound interceptor will consume to bootstrap the main group.

## Verify

- Check logs: `tail -20 logs/nanotars.log | grep -i discord`
- Send a test message and confirm the agent responds

## Troubleshooting

- **Bot not connecting**: Check `DISCORD_BOT_TOKEN` in `.env`
- **Bot online but not reading messages**: Enable **Message Content Intent** in Discord Developer Portal > Bot > Privileged Gateway Intents
- **Messages not received**: Run `/list-groups` from your main chat to confirm the Discord chat is registered. Don't reach into the SQLite schema directly — the entity-model migration will silently break inline SQL.
- **No response in group channel**: Check trigger pattern matches or set `requiresTrigger: false`
- **Bot can't send messages**: Ensure bot has `Send Messages` permission in the channel

## Uninstall

Use `/nanotars-remove-plugin` for a guided removal — it stops the service, removes the plugin directory, cleans up channel data, and removes registered-group entries via the proper IPC primitives. Manual steps if needed:

1. `nanotars stop`
2. From your main chat (before stopping), run `/delete-group <folder>` for each Discord-wired group you want to remove. Skip this if you want the agent_group rows preserved for re-wiring to a different channel.
3. `rm -rf plugins/channels/discord/`
4. Remove `DISCORD_BOT_TOKEN` from `.env`
5. `nanotars restart`

6. **Restart NanoTars** — group folders and message history are preserved.
