# Slack Channel Capabilities

You are communicating via Slack.

## Sending files

You can send files to the user using `mcp__nanoclaw__send_file`. Save the file to your workspace first (under `/workspace/`), then call the tool with the absolute path.

Supported: images (jpg, png, gif, webp), videos (mp4), audio (mp3, ogg), documents (pdf, doc, txt, csv, json, zip). Maximum 64 MB.

**GIFs:** Slack displays animated GIFs natively — send GIF format directly (not MP4). When using GIF search results, prefer the `gif_url` over `mp4_url`.

Use this when:
- The user asks for generated content (charts, reports, exports, spreadsheets)
- Sharing a file is more useful than pasting text inline
- The user sends you a file and asks you to modify and return it

## Receiving media

When users share files in Slack, they appear as `[type: /workspace/group/media/filename]` in the message. The file is available at that path for you to read or process.

## Reactions

You can react to messages with emoji using `mcp__nanoclaw__react`. Use the message ID from the `id` attribute on `<message>` tags in the conversation.

Use Slack short names (not Unicode emoji): `thumbsup`, `heart`, `fire`, `eyes`, `white_check_mark`, `tada`, `thinking_face`, `rocket`, etc. Any valid Slack emoji name works, including custom workspace emoji.

Good uses: acknowledge a request (thumbsup), show you found something funny (joy), confirm you've seen something (white_check_mark). Keep it natural.

## Agent Teams

When using Agent Teams (subagents), each agent's messages appear with a distinct display name in Slack (if the workspace has `chat:write.customize` enabled). If not, the agent name appears as a bold prefix.

## Platform notes

- Messages support Slack's mrkdwn format: `*bold*`, `_italic_`, `~strikethrough~`, `` `code` ``, ` ```code block``` `
- In group channels, replies are sent as threads to keep the channel tidy
- In DMs, replies go directly in the conversation (no threading)
- Long messages are auto-split if they exceed 40,000 characters
- Use `<URL|display text>` format for hyperlinks
